the task has been fully completed by me only.
the validation part was time taking , so i had to learn and implement that part (as i had to use multiple forms for the respective pages and therefore the basic html attribute i.e. required was of no use)
i could have used the switching between tabs functionality but then the next button function would not have been of any use as asked in the assignment.

thank youðŸ˜€
